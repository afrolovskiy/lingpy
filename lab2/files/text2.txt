2 English Collocations in Use 






I What is a collocation? 




We say . . . 


We don't say ... 


fast cars 
fast food 


quick food 


a quick glance 
a quick meal 


a fest glance 
a fe« meal 



A collocation is a pair or group of words that are often 
used together. These combinations sound natural to 
native speakers, but students of English have to make a 
special effort to learn them because they are often 
difficult to guess. Some combinations just sound 'wrong' 
to native speakers of English. For example, the adjective 
fast collocates with cars y but not with a glance. 

Learning collocations is an important part of learning the vocabulary of a language. Some 
collocations are fixed, or very strong, for example take a photo, where no word other than 
take collocates with photo to give the same meaning. Some collocations are more open, 
where several different words may be used to give a similar meaning, for example keep to / 
stick to the rules. Here are some more examples of collocations. 

You must make an effort and study for your exams (NOT de an effort) 

Did you watch TV last night? (NOT look at TV) 

This car has a very powerful engine. It can do 200 km an hour. (NOT otrong engine) 

There are some ancient monuments nearby. (NOT antique monuments) 

Sometimes, a pair of words may not be absolutely wrong, and people will understand what 
is meant, but it may not be the natural, normal collocation. If someone says / did a few 
mistakes they will be understood, but a fluent speaker of English would probably say 
I made a few mistakes. 

Compounds and idioms 

Compounds are units of meaning formed with two or more words. Sometimes the words 
are written separately, sometimes they have a hyphen and sometimes they are written as one 
word. Usually the meaning of the compound can be guessed by knowing the meaning of 
the individual words. Some examples of compounds are car park, post office, narrow- 
minded, shoelaces, teapot. 

It is not always easy to separate collocations and compounds and, where they are useful for 
learners or an important part of the vocabulary of a topic, we include some compounds in 
this book too. 

Idioms are groups of words in a fixed order that have a meaning that cannot be guessed by 
knowing the meaning of the individual words. For example, pass the buck is an idiom 
meaning c to pass responsibility for a problem to another person to avoid dealing with it 
oneself. We deal with idioms in detail in the book English Idioms in Use in this series. 

Why learn collocations? 

Learning collocations is a good idea because they can: 

a) give you the most natural way to say something: smoking is strictly forbidden is more 
natural than smoking is strongly forbidden. 

b) give you alternative ways of saying something, which may be more colourful/expressive or 
more precise: instead of repeating It was very cold and very dark, we can say // was 
bitterly cold and pitch dark. 

c) improve your style in writing: instead of saying poverty causes crime, you can say 
poverty breeds crime, instead of saying a big meal you can say a substantial meal. You 
may not need or want to use these in informal conversations, but in writing they can 
give your text more variety and make it read better: this book includes notes about 
formality wherever the collocations are especially formal or informal.

When I left university I made a decision to take up a 
profession in which I could be creative. I could play the 
guitar, but I'd never written any songs, nonetheless I 
decided to become a singer- songwriter. I made some 
recordings but I had a rather heavy cold so they didn't 
sound good. I made some more, and sent them to a 
record company and waited for them to reply. 
So, while I was waiting to become famous, I got a job 
in a fast-food restaurant. That was five years ago. 
I'm still doing the same job.

2 Finding, recording and learning collocations 

A Finding collocations 

There are two main ways in which you can find collocations. 

. You can train yourself to notice them whenever you read or listen to anything in English. 
Look at the collocations that are worth learning from this short text in English. 

After giving Mark a lift to the airport, Cathy made her way home. What an exciting life he 
led' At times Cathy felt desperately jealous of him. She spent her time doing little more 
than taking care of him and the children. Now her sister was getting divorced and would 
doubtless be making demands on her too. Cathy had promised to give her sister a call as 
soon as she got home but she decided to run herself a bath first. She had a sharp pain in her 
side and hoped that a hot bath might ease the pain. 



I 



Get into the habit of making a note of any good collocations you come across in any English text 
you read. 



• You can find them in any good learner's dictionary. 

For example, if you look up the word sharp you will find some of these collocations: 

a sharp pain 

a sharp bend/turn 

a sharp contrast/difference/distinction 

a sharp rise/increase/drop 

H When you look up a new word make a point of noting it down in several different collocations. 

Recording collocations 

The best way to record a collocation is in a phrase or a sentence showing how it is used. 
Highlight the collocation by underlining it or by using a highlighting pen. 

For example: I don't have access to that kind of secret information. 
Or: Jim gave me a very useful piece of advice. 

Learning collocations 

Learning collocations is not so different from learning any vocabulary item. The key things 
are to: 

• regularly revise what you want to learn 

. practise using what you want to learn in contexts that are meaningful for you personally 

• learn collocations in groups to help you fix them in your memory. You might group 
together collocations relating to the same topic. Or you might group collocations based 
on the same word, for example: 

I must find a way to help him. 

Can you find your way back to my house? 

I learnt the hard way that Jack can't be trusted. 

Please tell me if I'm getting in your way. 

You must give way to traffic from the left. 

I've tried every possible way to get him to change his mind.

3 Using your dictionary 



A good learner's dictionary will give you information on collocations. Sometimes the 
information is highlighted in some special way. In other cases, the examples used in the 
dictionary include the most common collocations. 

In the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary (CALD), common and useful collocations 
are given in bold type. Look at the CALD entry for the word pain and note how useful 
collocations are highlighted in bold. 



pain © /pein/ noun [c or u] 1 a feeling of physical suffer- 
ing caused by injury or illness: Her symptoms included 
abdominal pain and vomiting, o Are you in (= suffering 
from) pain? o She was in constant pain, o These tablets 
should help to ease the pain, o I felt a sharp pain in my 
foot, o He's been suffering various aches and pains for 
years. 2 emotional or mental suffering: It's a film about 
the pains and pleasures of parenthood, o The parents are 
still in great pain over the death of their child. 
• a pain (in the neck) informal someone or something 
that is very annoying: That child is a real pain in the 
neck. 



CD-ROM versions of dictionaries are 
useful because you can usually search 
for a lot more information very quickly 
indeed. The CALD CD-ROM has a 
special button labelled M imnMlMM i 
in many entries. Clicking on this button 
gives you a list of collocations. Here 
are the verb collocations for pain. The 
dictionary also gives adjectives and 
nouns which are used with pain. 



m Collocations | CALD 2 





pain 

Verbs 

experience / feel / suffer pain 

/ experienced chest pains and dizziness. 
alleviate / ease / lessen / relieve / soothe pain 

A hot bath may help to relieve the pain. 
cause / inflict pain

complain of pain 

She came in complaining of stomach pains. 
pain subsides 

As the pain subsided, I began to relax. 
be racked with pain 

He is emaciated and racked with pain. 

A good dictionary will also tell you if a collocation is formal or informal. For example, 
CALD indicates that to take somebody up on an offer is an informal collocation (accept an 
offer would be a more formal alternative). 



Offer & /'Df.a7 <S> /'a:.fa7 noun [C] when someone asks 
you if you would like to have something or if you would 
like them to do something: "If you like I can do some 
shopping for you. " "That's a very kind offer. " o I must say 
the offer of a weekend in Barcelona quite tempts me. 
o informal One day I'll take you up on (= accept) that 
offer. 



i 



When you buy a dictionary, make sure it gives good, clear information about collocations. When you 
look up words, if you don't know the collocations, highlight them in your dictionary or transfer 
them to your vocabulary notebook.

Register 



Often, collocations rather than individual words suggest a particular register. For example, 
phrases using pretty meaning fairly sound informal when used with negative adjectives 
(pretty awful, pretty dreadful, pretty dull), and are typical of spoken English. 

Spoken English 

Here are some more collocations which are almost exclusively found in spoken English. 



I'm bored stiff 

in this lesson! 




You badly need 
a haircut! 



I'll have a think about it 
and let you know. 



Give me a ring 2 
when you get home. 






'extremely bored give me a phone call 

Formal English 

Some collocations are typical of formal English and are most likely to be found in an 
official, often legal, context, such as in notices. 



Passengers must 

not alight from 

the bus whilst it 

is in motion. 



Cyclists must

without permission 



Please dispose of 

unwanted items 

in the receptacle 2 

provided 

'throw away 

Container used for storing 



will be taken to court) or putting objects in 



Newspaper English 

Some collocations - particularly ones that use short, dramatic words - are found mainly in 
newspapers. In most cases they would not normally be used in everyday conversation.

r 




Intensifying adverbs 



In English there are lots of other ways of saying very or very much. For example we can 
use words such as highly, utterly, bitterly, deeply. These alternatives collocate strongly with 
specific words, and other combinations often sound unnatural. 

Highly 



collocations 



comments 



(un)likely unusual successful competitive 
profitable effective controversial 

recommended 



Highly is used with some probability words (likely, 
unusual). With the exception of highly 
controversial it usually combines with very 
positive words. Extremely can also be used 
with all the opposite adjectives except recommended. 



It is highly unlikely that I'll finish my work on time. 
Jill's highly unusual behaviour began to worrv her n 



worry her parents. 



Absolutely, utterly 



collocations 



ridiculous stupid impossible wrong 
alone appalled convinced devastated 
miserable 



comments 



Absolutely and (slightly more formal) utterly combine 
with adjectives with very extreme meanings where we

Get is a very common verb in English, but it is not always appropriate for talking about 
changes. Note also alternatives to get which can improve your style.

The same is true for collocations with adjectives such as angry, bored, excited, depressed 

upset, impatient, violent:

1 2 Metaphor 



If someone uses a metaphor, they use a word in a way that is slightly different from its basd 
meaning. For example, the first meaning of sunny is connected with the weather, so we talk 
about a sunny day. However, sunny can also be used in expressions like a sunny smile, the 
children's sunny faces to mean happy; in these collocations sunny is used in a metaphorical 
way. Metaphors are more common in written than spoken English and often have the effect 
of sounding quite poetic. 

Light and dark 

Light in English is associated with happiness. So a face shines with pleasure and eyes shine 
with excitement or delight. If someone's face lights up or their eyes light up, they show that 
they suddenly feel happy. If an atmosphere lightens or a mood lightens, it becomes more 
relaxed or cheerful than it was. 

Darkness is associated with unhappiness and negative feelings. Dark thoughts are gloomy or 
sinister ones and dark days or dark times are unpleasant times to live through. If someone's 
face darkens or their eyes darken or someone's expression darkens, then we know that that 
person is unhappy, often because they are feeling angry.

9 Families 



Family relationships 

Sociologists talk about nuclear and extended families. A nuclear family is just parents and 
children. An extended family is a wider network including grandparents, cousins, etc. 

Close relatives are those like parents, children, brothers or sisters. Distant relatives are people 
like second cousins [the children of a cousin of your mother or father] or distant cousins. 

Close/immediate family refers to people who are your nearest blood relatives: 

I don't have much close/immediate family. 

She's a distant cousin of mine; she's not a blood relative. 

Close can also be used to mean that the relationship is a very strong one: 

We are a very close family, or We are a very close-knit family. 

These adjectives also collocate with family: 

loving, respectable, dysfunctional [unhappy, not working in a healthy way) 

Simon came from a respectable family, so Mary's parents felt happy about the marriage. 

Someone's late husband/wife is one who has died. 

An estranged [formal] husband/wife is one who lives in a different place and has a difficult 

relationship with their husband/wife. They may be having a trial separation and may 

eventually decide to get a divorce. In some cases it can be a bitter/acrimonious divorce, [full 

of anger, arguments and bad feeling] 

A person's ex-husband/ex-wife is a man/woman that she/he used to be married to. 

Children whose parents have separated or divorced are said to come from a broken home. 
If their family is a strong, loving one it can be called a stable home. If it is a poor one, not 
having the things that are necessary for a pleasant life, such as enough money, food or good 
living conditions, it can be called a deprived home. 

A confirmed bachelor is a man who seems to have no intention of ever marrying.

24 Films and books 




Talking about films and books 

When a new book or film conies out, newspapers will review it. The people who review the 
book/film are called book reviewers / film critics and they write book/film reviews. If they 
don't like a book/film they give it a bad review. We can say that a novel or film is based on 
a true story. We say that a book/film captures an atmosphere or that a book/film deals with 
a topic. We talk about the opening/closing scenes of a film and the opening/closing chapters 
of a book. We talk about the beginning and end of a book/film (NOT start and finish ). If 
everything works out well for the central characters, we say that the book/film has a happy 
ending. You may recommend a book/film that you enjoyed to a friend. If a lot of people 
have enjoyed it, it is highly recommended. 

Just about films and acting 

Fve never had any desire to go on the stage 1 myself but I'd love to produce a film. I think 
historical dramas work particularly well on the big screen 2 and I'd love to make a film 
about Vikings in Britain. There'd be plenty of opportunities to use special effects 3 during 
battle scenes. I'd want the male lead 4 to be played by Hugh Grant, while Nicole Kidman 
could have the female lead. Sean Penn could play the role of a Viking warrior and I'd like 
Judi Dench to take on a cameo role 5 . I'm sure that, as always, she would give an excellent 
performance. My dream is to make a film that would be nominated for an Oscar 6 . Of 
course, I'd also like it to be an immediate box-office hit 7 , playing to full houses 8 worldwide.

Winning and losing 

Sportsmen and sportswomen want to win matches, not lose matches. But you can't win all 
the time! Sometimes a team or player deserves to win, but gets narrowly defeated/beaten. 

Before they go in for / enter a competition, athletes train hard. They probably attend/do 
least five training sessions a week. They are likely to put up a fight to gain/get a place in the 
next stage/round of the competition. Of course, a sportsperson's ultimate aim is to break 
the world record in their sport. If they succeed, they set a new world record and become a 
world record holder. They are sure to come up against fierce/intense competition as they try 
to achieve their ambitions. Sometimes they are satisfied if they just achieve a personal best. 

Some sports people so desperately want to win that they take drugs to enhance their 
performance. This will be discovered when they fail a drugs test. 

Football 

You can play or have a (football) match / game (of football). It might be a home or an away 
match depending on whether you're playing on your team's home ground or not. 

The aim is to score a goal. Players may tackle an opponent to try to take possession of the 
ball 1 . If you tackle in an illegal way, you foul your opponent. This will lead to the referee 
blowing his whistle and an opponent taking a penalty or taking a free kick. If someone isn't 
playing very well the manager may decide to drop the player from the team or bring on a 
substitute 2 . Both teams hope that they will have taken the lead 3 by half-time.

Going into business 

Interviewer: When did you first go into business? 

I set up a small business selling office supplies in 1989, filing systems, office 
equipment, that sort of thing. In 1991 I went into partnership with my old 
friend, James Britten. We made a loss for the first two years, but then things 
got better and we've made a profit most years ever since. But there have been 
bad times too. 
In what way? 

Well, during the economic recession of the early 1990s, a lot of small 
businesses were going under', and I thought our business would fold 2 , but we 
survived. All around us, small firms were going bankrupt 3 . But in 1994 we 
won a contract, despite stiff competition, to supply the local government 
otnees and that was an important moment for us. We took on staff and 
expanded. And we were proud that we had created jobs for local people at a 
time when unemployment was high. Our sales figures improved steadily, and 
soon we had an annual turnover 4 of more than ten million pounds 
So what's the secret of your success? 

Well we're quite cautious. For instance, we always carry out 5 market research 
before launching a new product. But also, we set a high value on customer 
service especially after-sales service. But at the end of the day, running a 
successful business is a combination of hard work, luck and intuition, 
finally, there are rumours that you may float the company 6 on the stock 
market. 

At the moment we have no intention of going public 7 , and people shouldn't 
believe everything they read in the newspapers!

Stating things strongly and less strongly 

The sentences below express opinions, either strongly or less strongly. 

Strong expressions of opinion 

The invention of the steam engine was the key factor in the birth of the industrial 

revolution. , •• 1 u 

The events of 1954 are a perfect example of how political leaders make misjudgements that 

have serious long-term effects. 

This is a clear illustration of the importance of a strong monetary policy. 

Less strong expressions of opinion 

The figures offer a tentative explanation of the causes of acid rain pollution, [an explanation 

given by someone who is not totally certain that it is the correct explanation] 

The statistics broadly support the view that the economy is heading towards recession. 

Other general academic collocations 

There is a strong tendency in the work of some linguists to suggest that spoken language is 

inferior to written language. 

We must first gather evidence, then carry out a detailed study of all the factors that play a 

part in social conditioning. 

You cannot expect your claim to be accepted if you cannot offer supporting evidence. 

Simon Hart challenges the theory of social change put forward by Professor Kemp.

complete rethinking of how we understand space. The author, Patrick Rivaux, puts forward the argument that the 
universe is as it is because we humans are here looking at it. The author takes up / adopts the position that the 
universe cannot have any beginning or end, and states his opinion that we can never understand the universe 
using the human ideas of time and space. He argues convincingly 3 that the universe has a unique nature. He 
draws attention to new research which suggests that other universes may also exist alongside ours. He briefly

why we're determined to tackle crime."

38 War and peace 




War 

When war broke out 1 , my grandfather joined the army. War was declared on his 25th 
birthday. He didn't want to go to war but he had no choice. The government were 
sending troops to the south where they expected fierce fighting. At first there were just 
minor incidents but soon it developed into all-out war 2 . My grandfather has told me how 
terrified he was the first time he came within firing range 3 of the enemy. They saw him 
and opened fire 4 but he was able to escape. A couple of his friends, though, were killed 
or taken prisoner. After several months our army went into action in the first decisive 
battle of the war. The battle raged 5 for several days. My grandfather said he hated being 
involved in fighting the war and that the only armies we should have should be 
peacekeeping forces. He can never forget the horrors of war, and he believes 
that we must do everything we can to avert 6 war in the future. I agree.

Poverty 

Look at this radio interview with Pascal Delrio, an international expert, talking about poverty. 

Interviewer: Mr Delrio, do you believe we can solve the problem of world poverty? 

Delrio: I am more optimistic now than before. Millions of people have succeeded in 

escaping poverty in the last decade, but it is also true that in some regions, 
more people than ever are living below the poverty line, and we must help 
these people to lift them out of poverty. 

Interviewer: But how can we achieve that? 

Delrio: I accept that there is no simple solution. The widening gulf between rich and 

poor in some countries is often due to external forces beyond their control. 
Some of the most deprived regions have large populations living on the 
margins of society, and it is for these specific groups that we can do most. 

Interviewer: But poverty is not just an issue for developing countries, is it? We have 

thousands sleeping rough 2 every night in cities like London and New York, 
and street children in a lot of big cities around the world. 

Delrio: I agree, and I accept that children and adults who live on the streets are in 

desperate need, and that these social conditions breed crime. But so much 
depends on the global economy. Right now, we have a golden opportunity to 
combat poverty. Perhaps we cannot eradicate 3 poverty altogether, but we can 
certainly alleviate 4 poverty, and that is our challenge. 

Interviewer: Mr Delrio, thank you very much.

Thousands of people seek political asylum in other countries every year. Most are genuine 

asylum seekers, but some are economic migrants looking for a better life. 

Hundreds of people took to the streets to demonstrate about third-world debt repayments.

Little , small and large 

We talk about low prices, low wages, low levels. (NOT small ) 

We say small quantities, small numbers, small amounts, a small increase. (NOT little ) 

The opposite is large quantities, large numbers, large amounts, a large increase. Similarly, 

we talk about problems or objects being on a large scale or on a small scale: 

If you are walking in the mountains you need a large scale map. 

The UK has similar problems to the USA, but on a smaller scale. 

In informal spoken English we often use little after another adjective to make it sound more 
friendly, e.g. poor little Joe, dear little dog, nice little room. 

Little can also mean young, e.g. little brother [informal: younger brother, NOT small 
brother; the opposite is big brother). Sometimes little or small suggests that something is not 
very important, e.g. a little problem, I've got a lot of little things to do, to make someone 
look small, to make small talk [talk socially, about unimportant subjects). 

Other size collocations 

We can talk about fat books and slim books as well as fat people and slim people. Only 
people (not books) can be plump or skinny or painfully thin. 

We use a great deal of (NOT large or -big) in contexts like this: 

She should be able to help you because she has a great deal of time / a great deal of money / 

a great deal of energy / a great deal of enthusiasm. 

Major and minor often collocate with words relating to problems or points in an argument, 
e.g. major/minor difference, major/minor change, major/minor effect, major/minor 
difficulty, major/minor point, major/minor issues, major/minor factor.

Mm. Yes I had a quick word with Lorna about it yesterday; she said there have 
been problems. 

Could we talk now? I know it's a delicate subject but I don't think we need to 
make it a lengthy discussion with everyone involved. 
Well, actually, I'm rather glad you raised the subject. Yes, let's talk 
Well, speaking off the record 1 , every time you give her instructions^ she never seems 
to understand, and if you challenge her directly she just pleads ignorance 2 The 
other secretaries are complaining bitterly that they end up doing her work. One of 
them dropped a hint that she might resign if nothing is done about it. I could tell 
by the tone of her voice that she was serious. 

Oh dear. Oh well, I'll have a word with her and make it clear that she has to 
improve or we may have to ask her to leave. 

Thanks, David. Anyway, let's change the subject. How's the sales plan going* 
Oh not bad, but I have to tell you the truth, I've been very busy with other things 
lately. In tact I was going to ask you a favour ... 
I know what you're about to say! Don't worry, I'll help you with it.

Dear Aunt Cloda, 

I find it difficult to get into conversation 
with new people, or to join in a 
conversation that's already started. 
And even if I do talk to someone, I feel 
as if I'm boring them. I like meeting 
people and I want to be able to get to 
know them and not just make polite 
conversation. What can I do?

Why can't I relax and be informal?

Ways of walking 



Key walking collocations 

Cathy always preferred to go places on foot rather than driving. She loved going for a walk 
in the park in the early morning. There were always a surprising number of people around. 
Some were taking a stroll with their dogs, while more energetic people chose to go jogging. 
Cathy liked going running too, but she preferred to go for a run in the evenings. In the 
morning she liked a brisk walk. Today she was surprised to see a man pacing up and down 
beside the lake. He was taking long steps as if he was measuring the length of the lake. 
Cathy was puzzled but thought little more of it at the time.

Walking through life 

Walking collocations are often used metaphorically. Notice the examples in this text. 

Jack always did very well at school. He walked 1 every exam he ever went in for. His 
teachers used to call him a walking encyclopaedia. It was only when he left school that he 
began to run into problems. He couldn't decide what job to choose. Many different walks 
of life appealed to him. He didn't want to rush headlong into 2 something that he would 
later regret. Eventually he decided he most wanted to become a writer. The next day he 
took his first faltering steps 3 at writing a novel. After only a month or two he had made 
great strides 4 and was ready to take his book to a publishing house. It was here that he ran 
up against some opposition. He seemed to get off on the wrong foot 5 with the publishers, 
who didn't like him and turned his book down. They're sorry now! A second publisher 
accepted his novel and it's already a best-seller world-wide. 
1 passed very easily (informal) 2 start doing something too quickly 

3 not very confident steps. You can also talk about careful/tentative steps when someone is 
doing something which they are not confident about. 

4 made great progress 5 make a bad start to a relationship

Praising 

Read this review of a theatre production from a local newspaper. 




I have nothing but praise for this production of 
Dogs and offer my congratulations to all the 
cast. The thunderous applause at the end of 
last night's performance was richly deserved. 
The actors had managed to put on a simply 
dazzling production. James King, in particular, 
gaxe an outstanding performance. Of course, 
the cast cannot take full credit for its success; 



we must also warmly congratulate the 
producer. He has received critical acclaim 1 

many times in the past. He justly deserves all 
the rave reviews 2 he will undoubtedly receive 
from many others as well as myself. We must also 
give credit to the production's wardrobe 
department. I am sure they will also win a lot oi 
praise for their original and exciting costumes.

not lose your patience with your friends, but if someone seems to enjoy making a fool 
out of you in front of other people, do those rules of friendship still apply? 

3 I'm a little shy, though not painfully shy, but sometimes I think I give the impression 
that I'm unfriendly. How can I convince people that I'm good company and worth 

getting to know? 

4 Should I talk about personal matters to my closest colleague at work? She is not very 
good at keeping secrets and she has a very vivid imagination. She always promises not 
to tell other people, but I'm not sure she always keeps her word. 

5 My boyfriend has a really friendly, outgoing personality and a great sense of humour. 
He's highly intelligent and has a razor-sharp mind. The perfect man. We've been 
together now for a year, and I like him a lot, but don't love him any more. Should I be 
brutally honest with him and tell him? 

6 I think a friend is destroying himself with drugs. I feel a sense of responsibility towards 
him. He has always been fiercely loyal to me in good and bad times, which is a 
wonderful aspect of his personality. I feel I ought to contact the police or social 
services, but I don't want to make a snap decision which I'll regret later.

2 B: No, it's true. He just can't take a joke, can he?

Dear Joanne, 

I too am seething with anger over this pension question. I tried to express my disappointment over it to the Board, but they

Have you read that new book that has just come out about Ireland? 

No, I don't go to bookshops and I don't read book reviews. What's it about? 

Well, it deals with the Irish War of Independence. It's very authentic and it 

manages to capture the atmosphere of Ireland at the beginning of the 20th 

century. 

Is it just historical facts, then? 

No, the central characters are two brothers who have different opinions 

about the war and this divides their family. In the opening chapters they're 

happy and do everything together, but by the closing chapter they have 

become enemies. 

Mm, it sounds a bit depressing to me. 

Well, it certainly doesn't have a happy ending, but I liked it, and it's highly 

recommended by all the critics. 

So, a book with a pleasant beginning and a sad end(ing). Not for me, I'm 

afraid. I prefer the opposite.

would make a change from playing computer games. You can do lots of different

33 4 Kerr takes up a controversial position in his latest article. He puts forward the argument 
that differences in behaviour between the sexes can be explained totally by the genes. He 
attempts to make a case for educating boys and girls separately in their primary school 
years He argues, occasionally convincingly, that both sexes would benefit from this. He 
draws attention to recent research which, he claims, lends support to his argument. 
However he fails to take a number of important factors into consideration. He also 
makes no reference to the important work of Potter and Sinclair in this field. I am sure 
that I will not be alone in disagreeing profoundly with many of his conclusions.
